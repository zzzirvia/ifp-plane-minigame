# ✈️ IFP Plane Minigame

This is a 2D Android minigame developed as part of a course project, featuring a player-controlled airplane, enemies, projectiles, and a scoring system. The game is designed with a custom interface and simple yet engaging mechanics.

## 🎮 Game Features

1. **Custom Graphical Interface**  
   The user interface is fully designed without relying on code generation tools, and it differs from any base template or original source.

2. **Joystick-Controlled Airplane Movement**  
   The airplane can be moved using an on-screen joystick, giving the player intuitive control over its direction.

3. **Tap-to-Shoot Mechanism**  
   The airplane fires bullets when the player taps on the airplane itself.

4. **Random Enemy Spawning**  
   Enemies are generated at random time intervals to keep gameplay unpredictable and dynamic.

5. **Score Display**  
   A score counter is shown at the top-left corner of the screen, updating with each enemy destroyed.

6. **Enemy Explosions**  
   When a bullet hits an enemy, the enemy explodes with a visual effect.

7. **Game Over Conditions**  
   If an enemy reaches the ground, it causes an explosion and triggers a defeat UI screen.

8. **Pause and Resume Functionality**  
   Tapping anywhere on the screen (except the joystick or airplane) pauses or resumes the game.

9. **Restart After Defeat**  
   The game allows players to restart immediately after losing.
